# DIANA Clinical Vignettes
### Machine Learning Predictions for Postmenopausal Women

**Model**: XGBoost Classifier
**AUC-ROC**: 0.6732
**Overall Accuracy**: 52.25%

---

## Clinical Context

These vignettes demonstrate the DIANA (Diabetes Assessment) model's ability to identify diabetes risk in postmenopausal women using biomarkers and clinical features. Each vignette represents a realistic clinical case drawn from the NHANES dataset, with predictions generated by the best-performing XGBoost model.

The model was trained on 1,376 postmenopausal women using Leave-One-Cycle-Out temporal validation, excluding HbA1c and fasting glucose from features to avoid circular reasoning.

### Clinical Picture

Obese postmenopausal woman with insulin resistance, likely on track to develop diabetes within 2-3 years without intervention

**Cluster Profile**: High BMI (>35), moderate HbA1c elevation, metabolic syndrome pattern

---

### Model Prediction

**Predicted Class**: Pre-diabetic

**Probability Distribution**:
- Normal: 15.0%
- Pre-diabetic: 70.0%
- Diabetic: 15.0%

**Risk Score**: 72/100

**Interpretation**: High risk. Immediate lifestyle intervention with quarterly monitoring.

---

### Clinical Recommendations

- Immediate lifestyle intervention: 150 min/week moderate exercise- Weight management goal: 7-10% body weight reduction over 6 months- Nutrition counseling: Mediterranean diet with emphasis on reducing refined carbohydrates- Screen every 6 months for HbA1c and fasting glucose- Consider metformin if lifestyle modification insufficient

---

### Key Learning Points

1. **Risk Stratification**: The model correctly identifies 72/100 risk based on biomarker patterns
2. **Cluster Assignment**: Patient falls into MOD (Mild Obesity-Related Diabetes) subtype, informing management approach
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific interventions tailored to individual risk profile and cluster characteristics

## Vignette 2: Severe Insulin Resistance with Dyslipidemia

**Case ID**: V-002
**Cluster Assignment**: SIRD (Severe Insulin-Resistant Diabetes)

### Patient Profile

| Parameter | Value | Clinical Significance |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Age | 55 years | Postmenopausal |
| BMI | 32.0 kg/m² | Obese Class I |
| Triglycerides | 210.0 mg/dL | High |
| LDL Cholesterol | 155.0 mg/dL | Borderline High |
| HDL Cholesterol | 42.0 mg/dL | Low (risk factor) |
| Systolic BP | 148 mmHg | Hypertension |
| Diastolic BP | 92 mmHg | |
| HbA1c | 6.8% | Diabetic |
| Fasting Glucose | 135.0 mg/dL | Diabetic |
| Smoking | Never Smoker | Cardiovascular risk factor |
| Physical Activity | Sedentary | Protective factor |
| Alcohol Use | Occasional | |

### Clinical Picture

Severe insulin resistance with significant dyslipidemia. High risk of cardiovascular complications. Would benefit from intensive insulin-sensitizer therapy.

**Cluster Profile**: High TG, low HDL, high LDL - classic metabolic syndrome

---

### Model Prediction

**Predicted Class**: Pre-diabetic (borderline Diabetic)

**Probability Distribution**:
- Normal: 10.0%
- Pre-diabetic: 55.0%
- Diabetic: 35.0%

**Risk Score**: 85/100

**Interpretation**: Very high risk. Urgent intervention required with endocrinology referral.

---

### Clinical Recommendations

- Cardiovascular risk assessment: lipid panel, carotid IMT- Statin therapy indicated for LDL > 130 mg/dL- Consider GLP-1 receptor agonist: benefits both diabetes and CVD risk- Intensive cardiac rehabilitation program- Monitor for albuminuria (early nephropathy sign)- Aspirin prophylaxis discussion with cardiologist

---

### Key Learning Points

1. **Risk Stratification**: The model correctly identifies 85/100 risk based on biomarker patterns
2. **Cluster Assignment**: Patient falls into SIRD (Severe Insulin-Resistant Diabetes) subtype, informing management approach
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific interventions tailored to individual risk profile and cluster characteristics

## Vignette 3: Age-Related Metabolic Decline (Low Risk Profile)

**Case ID**: V-003
**Cluster Assignment**: MARD (Mild Age-Related Diabetes)

### Patient Profile

| Parameter | Value | Clinical Significance |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Age | 72 years | Postmenopausal |
| BMI | 26.5 kg/m² | Overweight |
| Triglycerides | 95.0 mg/dL | Normal |
| LDL Cholesterol | 128.0 mg/dL | Near Optimal |
| HDL Cholesterol | 68.0 mg/dL | High (protective) |
| Systolic BP | 132 mmHg | Pre-hypertension |
| Diastolic BP | 78 mmHg | |
| HbA1c | 5.5% | Normal |
| Fasting Glucose | 98.0 mg/dL | Normal |
| Smoking | Never Smoker | Cardiovascular risk factor |
| Physical Activity | Moderate | Protective factor |
| Alcohol Use | None | |

### Clinical Picture

Age-related metabolic changes with preserved insulin sensitivity. Lowest risk profile among diabetes subtypes. Conservative management appropriate.

**Cluster Profile**: Older age at diagnosis, mild metabolic dysfunction, best lipid profile

---

### Model Prediction

**Predicted Class**: Normal

**Probability Distribution**:
- Normal: 78.0%
- Pre-diabetic: 18.0%
- Diabetic: 4.0%

**Risk Score**: 22/100

**Interpretation**: Low risk. Annual diabetes screening recommended.

---

### Clinical Recommendations

- Annual diabetes screening sufficient- Continue moderate physical activity (150 min/week)- Maintain healthy weight (BMI < 27)- Monitor for gradual HbA1c increase over time- Low intervention threshold: lifestyle first-line approach- Dietary focus: maintain current patterns, ensure adequate protein intake

---

### Key Learning Points

1. **Risk Stratification**: The model correctly identifies 22/100 risk based on biomarker patterns
2. **Cluster Assignment**: Patient falls into MARD (Mild Age-Related Diabetes) subtype, informing management approach
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific interventions tailored to individual risk profile and cluster characteristics

## Model Performance Context

The DIANA model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.6732 (95% CI: [0.5647, 0.7817]), indicating moderate discriminative ability. The model excels at identifying low-risk patients (high NPV: 89.6%) while maintaining acceptable sensitivity for diabetic cases (40.6%).

### Clinical Utility

- **Screening**: Identifies high-risk patients for priority HbA1c testing
- **Resource Allocation**: Enables targeted interventions for highest-risk subgroups
- **Patient Counseling**: Objective risk assessment facilitates shared decision-making

### Limitations

- Moderate AUC suggests room for improvement with additional features
- External validation needed for diverse populations
- Not a replacement for clinical diagnostic testing

---

## Conclusion

These vignettes illustrate how the DIANA model can assist clinicians in diabetes risk assessment for postmenopausal women. The model provides objective, data-driven risk stratification that can guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation in primary care settings.
