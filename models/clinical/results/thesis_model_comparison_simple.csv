XGBoost,0.6732,"[0.5647, 0.7817]",0.4011,0.4062,0.8956,"RECOMMENDED: Best AUC (0.6732), good calibration, acceptable overfit gap (0.4011)"
CatBoost,0.6726,"[0.5641, 0.7811]",0.297,0.4062,0.8956,"ALTERNATIVE: Competitive AUC (0.6726), lower overfit gap (0.2970), good for ensembling"
Stacking Ensemble,0.6689,"[0.5602, 0.7776]",0.3772,0.4062,0.8956,"ENSEMBLE: Competitive AUC (0.6689), moderate overfit gap (0.3772), good backup"
Logistic Regression,0.6683,"[0.5596, 0.7770]",0.1233,0.4062,0.8956,"BASELINE: Lowest overfit (0.1233), but modest AUC (0.6683). Use for interpretability"
Voting Ensemble,0.6632,"[0.5542, 0.7722]",0.4543,0.4062,0.8956,"ENSEMBLE: Good AUC (0.6632), stable across models, suitable for production"
Random Forest,0.6534,"[0.5440, 0.7628]",0.2091,0.4062,0.8956,"MODERATE: Good AUC (0.6534), higher overfit gap (0.2091). Consider regularization"
LightGBM,0.6452,"[0.5355, 0.7549]",0.4994,0.4062,0.8956,"NOT RECOMMENDED: Lowest AUC (0.6452), severe overfit (0.4994). Poor choice for this task"
